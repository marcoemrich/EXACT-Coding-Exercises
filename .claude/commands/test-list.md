description: Create a test list for TDD - write test cases using it.todo() before any implementation
---

# Test List Command

**MANDATORY**: Use the Task tool with `subagent_type: "test-list"` to create the test list.

Do NOT perform this phase manually. The agent enforces TDD discipline and prevents common mistakes.

Provide the agent with the necessary context:
- Feature/function to implement
- Target file paths (test file + implementation file)
- Any constraints or requirements from the user
