description: Enter the Green phase of TDD - implement minimal code to make the test pass

# Green Phase Command

**MANDATORY**: Use the Task tool with `subagent_type: "green"` to run the Green phase.

Do NOT perform this phase manually. The agent enforces TDD discipline and prevents common mistakes.

Provide the agent with the necessary context:
- Test file path
- Failing test name and expected behavior
- Current error message
- Implementation file path
